Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.\nAssemble and Roll the Polis:\nDivide the dough into equal-sized balls. On a lightly floured surface, roll out each dough ball into a thin circle. Place a spoonful of the cooled puran filling in the center of the dough circle. Gently gather the edges of the dough circle towards the center, pinching them together to form a semi-circle or a pouch around the filling. Make sure to seal the edges properly to prevent the filling from leaking out while cooking. Dust the stuffed dough ball with flour and gently roll it out again into a circle, making sure the filling is evenly distributed. Be careful not to roll it too thin, or the filling might burst open.\nCook the Polis:\nHeat a griddle or tawa over medium heat. Once hot, place the rolled poli on the griddle.

Knead the dough for 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.\nShape the Wadis:\nDivide the dough into equal-sized balls. On a lightly oiled surface, roll out each ball into a cylindrical shape, about 5-6 inches long and ½ inch thick. You can also use a rolling pin to achieve a more uniform thickness.\nSteam the Wadis (Optional):\nThis step is optional but adds a unique texture to the wadi. In a steamer basket, arrange the rolled wadis in a single layer, making sure they don\'t touch each other. Steam the wadis for 10-12 minutes over medium heat.\nDeep Fry the Wadis:\nHeat oil in a deep pan or kadhai over medium heat.

Garnish with boiled eggs, sliced carrots, cucumbers, and chopped coriander leaves (optional).','120 mins',3,0,0),(34,'Chicken 65','Marinate the Chicken:\nWash and pat dry the chicken pieces. In a large bowl, combine the chicken with yogurt/buttermilk, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, cumin powder, turmeric powder, coriander powder, and salt. Mix well and coat the chicken pieces evenly. Marinate for at least 30 minutes, or preferably overnight for deeper flavors.\nPrepare the Coating:\nIn a separate bowl, whisk the beaten egg with a splash of water. In another bowl, add some cornflour (or rice flour) for coating the chicken.\nDouble Coat the Chicken:\nDip each marinated chicken piece first in the egg mixture, then coat it evenly with the cornflour (or rice flour). You can repeat the egg and cornflour coating process for a thicker and crispier crust (optional).\nHeat Oil for Frying:\nHeat the vegetable oil in a deep pan or wok over medium heat. Once the oil is hot enough (around 350°F or 175°C), test it by dropping a small piece of coated chicken. If it sizzles and floats immediately, the oil is ready.\nFry the Chicken:\nCarefully add the chicken pieces in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan. Fry for 3-4 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through. Remove the fried chicken pieces with a slotted spoon and drain them on paper towels to absorb excess oil.\nTemper the Curry Leaves (Optional):\nIn the same oil (on low heat), add a few curry leaves and dry red chilies (optional). Fry for a few seconds until fragrant. Be careful as the curry leaves might splatter.\nServe Hot:\nOnce all the chicken is fried, discard the curry leaves and chilies from the oil (if used).  Garnish the fried chicken with the tempered curry leaves and dry red chilies (if used) and serve hot with your favorite chutney or dip.','50 mins',3,0,0),(35,'Pongal','Wash and Soak (Optional):\nYou can rinse the rice and moong dal together for 15-20 minutes. While not strictly necessary, soaking can help reduce cooking time slightly.\nPressure Cook or Stovetop Method:\nPressure Cooker:\nAdd the rinsed rice, moong dal, water, salt, and ghee or oil to a pressure cooker. If using, add a pinch of hing. Pressure cook for 4-5 whistles or until the rice and lentils are cooked through. Let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes before opening the lid.\nStovetop:\nIn a pot, combine the rinsed rice, moong dal, water, salt, and ghee or oil. If using, add a pinch of hing. Bring the water to a boil, then reduce heat, cover the pot, and simmer for 20-25 minutes, or until the rice and lentils are cooked through and the mixture thickens. Stir occasionally and add more water if needed to prevent burning.\nVen Pongal (Savory Version):\nIn a small pan, heat a little ghee or oil. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter. Once they splutter, add curry leaves and green chili (if using). Fry for a few seconds until fragrant. Mash the cooked rice and dal mixture slightly with a potato masher (optional) for a smoother texture. Add the tempered mixture (cumin seeds, curry leaves, etc.) to the cooked rice and dal. Mix well and serve hot. You can garnish with chopped cashews (optional).\nSakkarai Pongal (Sweet Version):\nOnce the rice and dal are cooked through (in the pressure cooker or pot), add the grated jaggery and stir well. Continue to cook and stir on low heat until the jaggery melts and mixes well with the rice and dal mixture. Add the chopped cashews, crushed cardamom pods (if using), and a pinch of saffron strands (if using).Serve hot.','40 mins',3,0,0),(36,'Curd Rice','Cook the Rice:\nYou can use leftover rice or cook fresh rice according to your preference.\nPrepare the Curd:\nTake the yogurt (curd) out of the refrigerator and stir it well to ensure a smooth consistency.\nCombine Rice and Curd:\nIn a bowl, combine the cooked rice and yogurt (curd). Add salt to taste and mix gently until everything is well combined. If the rice seems dry, you can add a little water or milk to achieve your desired consistency.\nTempering (Optional):\nIn a small pan, heat oil over medium heat. Add mustard seeds and let them splutter. Once they splutter, add asafoetida (if using), curry leaves, and green chili (if using). Saute for a few seconds until fragrant.\nAssemble and Serve:\nPour the tempering (if using) over the curd rice mixture. Gently fold it in to distribute the flavor. Garnish with chopped coriander leaves, grated carrot, chopped cucumber (optional), or any other toppings of your choice. Serve curd rice cool or at room temperature.','15 mins',3,0,0);
