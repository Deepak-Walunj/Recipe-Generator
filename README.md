Recipe Generator Web Application
This project is a comprehensive web application for discovering and exploring a variety of recipes from various cuisines. It utilizes HTML, CSS, Python Flask, and MySQL to provide a user-friendly and interactive platform.

Introduction
The Recipe Generator offers users a categorized library of recipes, with user authentication for accessing detailed recipe procedures.  Unauthorized users can still browse recipe ingredients. Additionally, an admin login page allows for user account management and recipe information updates.

Objectives
Design an intuitive and engaging user interface using HTML and CSS (responsive).
Develop a MySQL database schema to efficiently store and manage recipe data.
Utilize Python Flask to connect the frontend, backend logic, and the MySQL database.
Organize recipes into three distinct cuisines, each with twelve unique recipes.
Implement user authentication to control access to detailed recipe information.
Integrate an admin login page for managing users and recipes.
Ensure the application is scalable, secure, and performant.
Literature Survey
This project builds upon the following research papers:

Cooking recipes generator utilizing a deep learning-based language model (reference 1): Discusses the architecture and training of models like GPT and GAN for creating recipes based on existing databases.
Recipe Generator using Deep Learning (reference 2): Focuses on deep learning techniques for developing recipe generators, addressing issues like ingredient selection and user preferences.
Note: References are assumed to be listed in a separate section named "References" at the end of the README.

Methodology
Frontend Development:

HTML and CSS: Provide structure (HTML) and styling (CSS) for the user interface, ensuring responsiveness across various devices.
Backend Development:

Python Flask: Connects the frontend, backend logic, and the MySQL database, handling routing and user sessions.
MySQL Database: Implements a relational database schema to manage recipes, users, ingredients, and bookmarks.
User Authentication:

Login and Registration: Provides secure user registration and login with hashed passwords.
Session Management: Maintains user sessions through Flask's session management.
Access Levels: Differentiates between authenticated and unauthorized users for detailed recipe access.
Database Design:

Six interconnected tables manage cuisines, recipes, users, bookmarks, ingredients, and ingredient-recipe relationships.
Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity and efficient retrieval.
Future Scope

The application has potential for further development, including:

Expanded Recipe Database: Incorporate more cuisines and popular dishes.
Mobile Applications: Develop mobile versions for enhanced accessibility.
Nutritional Analysis: Add features for nutritional information and diet customization.
Community Engagement: Introduce forums and user-generated content.
Smart Appliances Integration: Enable integration with smart kitchen devices.
Conclusion
The Recipe Generator Web Application demonstrates the effective integration of HTML, CSS, Python Flask, and MySQL. It provides a user-friendly platform for exploring a variety of recipes, with user authentication and administrative functionalities for a secure and tailored user experience.
